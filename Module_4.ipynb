        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP is a programming paradigm that structures code around \"objects\" (data) rather than just functions (logic). It combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into single units to model real-world entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will possess.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "An object is a specific instance of a class. If the class is the blueprint for a house, the object is the actual house built from that blueprint, containing real data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction is about hiding complexity (showing only what is necessary), while Encapsulation is about data protection (bundling data and methods and restricting access). Abstraction is the design level; Encapsulation is the implementation level.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder (Double UNDERscore) methods, or \"Magic Methods\" (like __init__, __str__), allow objects to interact with Python's built-in behavior. They let you define how your objects handle operations like addition, printing, or length checking.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance allows a child class to acquire the properties and methods of a parent class. This promotes code reusability, as you don't need to rewrite code for shared behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same general class through the same method name (e.g., both Dog and Cat have a speak() method, but they act differently).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "It is achieved using underscores. A single underscore (_name) implies \"protected\" (internal use), while a double underscore (__name) triggers name mangling to make the variable private and harder to access from outside.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The __init__ method acts as the constructor. It is automatically executed when a new object is created to initialize the object's attributes (state).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Class Method (@classmethod) takes cls as the first argument and affects the entire class. A Static Method (@staticmethod) behaves like a regular function inside a class and doesn't access specific object or class data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading (same function name, different parameters). However, we can achieve similar behavior using default arguments (def add(a, b=0):) or variable-length arguments (*args).\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overriding happens when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The child's version replaces the parent's version for that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The @property decorator allows you to define a method that can be accessed like a variable (without parentheses). It is often used to implement \"getter\" and \"setter\" logic for Encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "It adds flexibility and makes code extendable. You can write a function that works with a general \"Animal\" type, and it will automatically work with any new \"Animal\" subclass you create in the future without changing the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "An abstract class is a blueprint that cannot be instantiated (you can't make an object from it). It contains abstract methods that force child classes to implement specific behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "It provides modularity (easier to troubleshoot), reusability (via inheritance), security (via encapsulation), and flexibility (via polymorphism), making large software easier to manage and scale.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Class Variable is shared by all objects of that class (changing it changes it for everyone). An Instance Variable belongs to one specific object (changing it only affects that object).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is when a child class inherits from more than one parent class at the same time. This allows the child to combine features from distinct sources (e.g., a FlyingCar inheriting from both Car and Airplane).\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ returns a readable string for end-users (what you see when you print()). __repr__ returns an unambiguous string meant for developers (useful for debugging and recreating the object).\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "super() allows a child class to call a method from the parent class. It is most commonly used in __init__ to ensure the parent class is set up correctly before the child adds its own data.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is the destructor. It runs automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (garbage collected) to perform cleanup tasks like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod?\n",
        "\n",
        "@classmethod can access and modify class state (using cls). @staticmethod cannot access class or instance data; it acts as an independent utility function that lives inside the class namespace.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "When a child class overrides a parent method, Python automatically calls the child's version at runtime. This allows you to loop through a list of different objects (parents and children) and call the same method name, getting the correct unique behavior for each.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is calling multiple methods sequentially (e.g., obj.move().turn()). It is achieved by making each method return self at the end, passing the object context to the next call.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method allows an object instance to be treated like a function. If you define this method, you can execute code by simply writing object_name() with parentheses."
