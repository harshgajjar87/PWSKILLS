    "1. What is a RESTful API? A RESTful API is a way for two computer programs to talk to each other over the internet. It acts like a waiter in a restaurant: the client (you) gives an order (request) to the waiter (API), and the waiter brings you the food (response/data) from the kitchen (server). It uses standard web actions like GET (read) and POST (create).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of API specification. An API specification is like a \"User Manual\" or blueprint for your API. It documents exactly what URLs are available (like /users or /login), what data they need, and what they return. This helps frontend developers (who build the app) know how to use your backend code without needing to read your Python files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs? Flask is a \"micro-framework\" for Python, meaning it provides just the bare essentials to run a web server. It is popular because it is very lightweight, easy to learn, and flexible. You don't have to use complex tools you don't need; you can get a basic API running in just 5 lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is routing in Flask? Routing is the process of mapping a specific URL (like /home) to a specific Python function in your code. It acts like a traffic director. When a user visits a URL, Flask checks its \"route map\" to decide which Python function should run to handle that request.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do you create a simple Flask application? To create a simple app, you import Flask, create an instance of it (app = Flask(__name__)), and define a route using @app.route('/'). Inside that route function, you return a message like \"Hello World\". Finally, you add app.run() to start the server so it can listen for requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs? The main HTTP methods match the standard actions you do with data: GET is for reading or fetching data. POST is for creating new data (like submitting a form). PUT is for updating existing data. DELETE is for removing data. These tell the server exactly what you want to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask? The @app.route() decorator connects a URL to a Python function. It tells Flask, \"When someone visits this web address, execute this function.\" Without this decorator, your function is just normal Python code and cannot be accessed by a web browser or mobile app.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods? GET is used to ask for data; the info is visible in the URL (like a search query) and is less secure. POST is used to send data to the server (like a password); the info is hidden inside the request body and is more secure. Use GET to view things and POST to change or create things.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs? You handle errors using the @app.errorhandler() decorator. Instead of showing a generic error page, this lets you run a custom function when a specific error (like 404 Not Found) happens. You can then return a clean JSON message (like {\"error\": \"User not found\"}) so the app knows exactly what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database? You typically use an extension called Flask-SQLAlchemy. You first configure the database address (URI) in your Flask settings. Then, you define \"Models\" (Python classes) that represent your database tables. This allows you to talk to the database using Python code instead of writing raw SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy? Flask-SQLAlchemy is a tool that acts as a bridge between your Python code and the SQL database. It is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper), which means it automatically translates your Python objects into database rows. It handles the messy work of opening connections and writing SQL queries for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful? Blueprints are a way to organize your Flask app into smaller, separate files (modules). Instead of writing all your code in one giant app.py, you can split it into files like auth.py (for login) and products.py (for items). This keeps your code clean and manageable as your project grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object? The request object holds all the data that the user (client) sent to your server. If a user submits a form, sends JSON data, or adds parameters to the URL, all that information is stored inside request. You use it in your function to \"read\" what the user wants.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask? You create an endpoint by defining a route (e.g., @app.route('/api/data')) and specifying the method (e.g., methods=['GET']). Inside the function, you fetch your data (like a dictionary or list) and return it using jsonify(). This turns your Python data into a format the web can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function? jsonify() converts Python dictionaries or lists into JSON format, which is the standard language for APIs. Crucially, it also tells the browser (via headers) that \"This is JSON data,\" ensuring that mobile apps and frontend websites treat the response correctly as data, not as a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function. url_for() generates URLs dynamically using the name of the function, rather than the URL path itself. This is safer because if you change your URL later (e.g., from /login to /signin), you don't have to fix every link in your code; url_for() will automatically update them all for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)? Flask looks for a special folder named static in your project. Any file you put there (images, CSS, JS) becomes publicly accessible. You link to them using url_for('static', filename='style.css'), which creates the correct path for the browser to download and display the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API? (Similar to Q2) An API spec is a written agreement on how the API behaves. For a Flask developer, it acts as a checklist: \"I need to build an endpoint at /users that takes an email and returns an ID.\" It ensures you build exactly what the frontend team expects, preventing bugs and confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API? Status codes are standard numbers that tell the client the result of their request (e.g., 200 for Success, 404 for Not Found, 500 for Server Error). They are important because computer programs rely on these numbers to decide what to do next (like showing a success message or an error alert) without reading the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask? You handle POST requests by adding methods=['POST'] to your route. Inside the function, you check if request.method == 'POST':. Then, you use request.form (for HTML forms) or request.json (for API data) to extract the information the user sent and process it (like saving it to a database).\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you secure a Flask API? You secure an API by implementing authentication, typically using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). This ensures only logged-in users can access data. You should also always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and validate all user inputs (sanitize them) to prevent attacks like SQL Injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension? Flask-RESTful is a library that makes building APIs easier by organizing them into Classes instead of just functions. It provides built-in tools for arguments parsing (validation) and formatting resources. It helps keep large APIs structured and follows best practices automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object? The session object allows the server to \"remember\" a user across different requests. It stores data (like a User ID) in a secure, signed cookie on the user's browser. This is how you keep a user logged in; the server checks the session cookie on every page load to know who the user is."
